ETG#1: Enter The Gateway

This virtual art exhibition was online for 28 days in February 2021. It shows some of Brunoâ€™s then-recent artworks and those of 18 friends and artists, most of which he met along his journey as a digital nomad in the Philippines in 2020.

While the pandemic kept the world on hold, he was having the fortune of feeling greatly inspired by living on the small pacific island Siargao for a year. Certainly, the inspiration arose from the uncertainty inherent to the special time the world was experiencing, the beauty and rawness of the island, and the simple island life - ultimately amplified by his vivid, intimate social surroundings. ETG#1 was born from this inspiration.

The exhibit was to share some of it, to give his very talented friends a humble platform for presenting their artworks. And, nonetheless, to celebrate the beauty of life! Also, this exhibition was thought to be the first of many more to come, one every year. So watch out for the next one!
